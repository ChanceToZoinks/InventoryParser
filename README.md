# InventoryParser
Path of Exile inventory value calculator

This tool calculates the total value of all currency, maps and unique maps held in the selected character's inventory based on the poe.ninja prices. The chaos/hr is displayed so you can track efficiency of certain farming or other moneymaking methods. The tool also tracks the current zone you're in, but that's mostly just cosmetic at the moment. Eventually the zone tracking will be used to gather historical data as a way to compare the money making efficiency of any given zone.

When I started working on this I had been programming in Python for about 2 days, so there will probably be many many refactors needed, and already I can see issues with my choice of implementation. 

TODO: Multithread. Add more features :^)
