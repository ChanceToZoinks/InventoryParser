Path of Exile inventory value calculator

You need a file called UserData.py in this format in the same folder:

##

account_name = ''

character_name = ''

league = ''

poesessid = ''

client_txt_path = ''

##

Still in the process of completing. Ultimately a GUI will be created to allow a user to input any necessary information without having to manually modify a file.
